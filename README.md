# BellyButton-Biodiversity


## Overview of the BellyButton-Biodiversity
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

The website link deployed in github is https://nishatsultana3538.github.io/BellyButton-Biodiversity/


Using two javascript file [charts.js](), one json file [samples.json]() and [index.html]() file I have generated a dashboard where a dropdown menu is listed  with the ID numbers of all the volunteers. When a volunteer ID is chosen from the dropdown menu, that person's demographics information as well as top 10 bacteria Cultures, bacteria Cultures per sample and belly button washing frequency per week will be displayed in the dashboard.

Below is how the website looks like
